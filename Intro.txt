As an old school RPG gaming enthusiast and a programmer I have set up a new Discord server for general xRPG related discussion. We talk about issues like ARPG, MMOs, MUDs, Roguelikes and traditiona cRPGs are covered. And we also can talk about other types of games including shooter looters and such. We already have active discussion about game development area as well. Base is set, we need people to join the chat. And joining is easy, just check my server and say hello to me: https://discord.gg/7DGYmk93

Meet you there, perhaps? Let me sing you about gold or shall you bring me a Shrubbery!
