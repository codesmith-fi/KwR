A new xRPG communityh - Knights who RPG

I put this description here in github because here it's easily accessible by everyone and I do not mess it up when trying post in other medias.

The point is:

New community - Knights who RPG - A new xRPG discord community starting up, not just ARPGs - we need you

I am a active member in many xRPG communities and want do my part. So if you are interested please stay a while and listen. I am forming a new xRPG (cRPG) community and I would like to get it started. We already have some active members discussing from gaming to game development. And of course, like an engineer what I am I want more <3 I am building a Discord based community for talking and sharing knowledge about computer and perhaps also NON-computer based Role Playing Games (RPGs).

Most immediately think that I mean Action RPGS. No, there are many good Discord servers already that cover that part. I want this new community not only to be related to Action RPGs but many other types as well. I want to be more general, focusing to xRPGs where x means that the type, platform or playstype is not predefined by just joining to my server. My server, itsounds bad, it will be OUR server, I am not gaining anything in this except friendship, disussion and fun time. I am hoping to partnership with the major ARPG Discord groups and bring our forces together. We will see.

I will be including chat channels for many kinds of RPG games including Roguelikes (ADOM, Netchack, Adom), MUDs (text based multi user dungeon games, BatMUD etc.), ARPGs (TQ, LE, GD, PoE, D3, Victor Vran...) of all kinds, MMOs and traditional cRPGs like Fallout, Witcher etc. I will even try to get out of the box and get us talking about SPACE RPGs suchs as Eve Online or Elite Dangerous for example. Also I will be including game development related discussions. We can stream gameplay look for people to join up in games etc etc. But we need to form up the basis of this server together. Even the discrod group/server is just few hours old we already have people in all of these areas I mentioned above. And we are growing and gaining more momentun and I want you in there.

So the fact is I need you and your friends.

If you are an enthusiastic xRPG player, try this server out. It's new, I need you and I need you to help starting the community up. I am a old school player who has been baked in many cRPG groups. I've played tabletop RPGs, MUDs, Roguelikes, mostly all MMOs and also basicly all ARPGs that I know of. Thousands of hours aimplessly seeking for the best next item, heh. You understood that aimlessly, I learned English language by playing games in the early 1980's. I've been a community driver earlier but in different kinds of projects and goals. Now I want to be a community driver which brins xRPG players together to discuss about role playing games on computers, on tabletops perhaps, Multi User Dungeons, rogues, even shooter looters. But I am not a community there alone just by myself, I need you. So...

Come help me to grow this community up and help us build this discord server up. I will offer important roles to people who are able to help me and able to offer their knowledge and time to get this thing starting up. I am not a adiscord professional, I can talk, I can do computer programs (sw engineer along with cRPG enthusiast) but I need help with discord in general.

So give me and this new discord group a chance. Let's build it up, together.

Here are the important details,

Server is named. Knights who RPG so in short KwR.

I am by no means trying to make a competitive community to other RPG Discord communities, I am just trying to get another group going on. I love to talk with people.

Yours, Xanaki
